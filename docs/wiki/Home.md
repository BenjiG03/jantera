# Canterax Wiki

Welcome to the **Canterax** documentation! This wiki provides a deep dive into the architecture, mathematical formulations, and validation of the library.

Canterax is a JAX-powered chemical kinetics library designed for **Automatic Differentiation**, **GPU acceleration**, and **batch reactor simulations**.

## 📚 Documentation Sections

| Section | Description |
